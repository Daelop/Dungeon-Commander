# Dungeon Commander (working title)

## Concept
The concept for this project is to create an auto-battler roguelite where the core gameplay loop/skill expression comes from programming your party using 'Commands'. These commands will be made up of targets, conditions and actions which the player will draft as a reward from combat alongside abilities.

## Current Goal

The current goal is to create a working simulation of the battle system as a proof of concept. The critera for success are:
- To allow for targets, conditions, and actions to be combined to create commands.
- To correctly determine character behavior from an array of commands.
- To accurately track and advance game state.
- Allow for character movement using a coordinate system.

## Next step

The next step, once a working simulator has been created, is to render a representation of the game state with basic interactive elements (e.g. a 'start battle' button).

## Future plans

The overall plan is to progressively iterate on the project by adding more features. Among the first in no particular order will be:
- Ability for players to change the combinations of command parts.
- Ability for players to equip characters with abilities.
- Reward system for winning combat.
- Multiple fights
- A boss fight
- Character selection screen
- Basic UI
